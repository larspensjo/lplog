lplog
=====

A gtk based viewer for log files.
The purpose is to make it easy to filter for key words.

Work in progress.

For Windows:
* install MinGW+MSYS
* Download the gtk+ super bundle from http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php and unpack it in /usr/local
* Make sure /local/bin is in the PATH if you use the MinGW shell
* If CodeBlocks is used, start it from the MinGW shell (to get the PATH).
